# Financial-Engineering-Quant-101
This repository tracks my structured journey into **financial engineering** and **quantitative finance**, implemented through reproducible Jupyter notebooks.

## Goals

- Build a solid foundation in stochastic calculus, derivatives pricing, and risk.
- Implement models from scratch to understand assumptions and limitations.
- Develop a portfolio of clean, well-documented quant code.

## Contents

- Foundations: probability, statistics, stochastic processes (Brownian motion, SDEs)
- Derivatives pricing: Black–Scholes, binomial trees, Greeks, implied volatility
- Fixed income: term structure, duration/convexity, simple interest-rate models
- Numerical methods: Monte Carlo, finite differences, optimization
- Risk & portfolio: VaR, CVaR, factor models, portfolio construction
- Quant strategies: signal research, backtesting prototypes

## Tech Stack

- Python, NumPy, pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter, JupyterLab
- (Optional) PyTorch / JAX for more advanced modeling

This repo is a work in progress. Notebooks are organized as lessons, each focusing on one concept at a time, with code, intuition, and experiments.
